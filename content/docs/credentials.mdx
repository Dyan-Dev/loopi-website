# Credentials Management

The Loopi Credentials Management system provides a secure way to store and reuse API keys, secrets, and authentication tokens across your automations.

## Overview

Instead of entering API credentials manually for each automation step, you can save them once in the Credentials Manager and reference them across multiple steps and automations.

## Features

- **Encrypted Storage**: All credentials are encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption before being saved to disk
- **Multiple Credential Types**: Support for Twitter, OAuth 2.0, API Keys, Basic Auth, and Custom credentials
- **Reusable**: Use the same credential across multiple automation steps
- **Secure**: Credentials are never exposed in logs or UI (shown as ••••••••)
- **Easy Management**: Add, edit, and delete credentials from the Settings page

## Credential Types

### Twitter/X
Store Twitter API v2 credentials for posting tweets, sending DMs, searching, etc.

**Required fields:**
- API Key
- API Secret
- Access Token
- Access Token Secret

### OAuth 2.0
Generic OAuth 2.0 credentials for third-party services.

**Required fields:**
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Redirect URI

### API Key
Simple API key authentication.

**Required fields:**
- API Key
- API URL (optional)

### Basic Auth
Username and password authentication.

**Required fields:**
- Username
- Password

### Custom
For custom authentication schemes not covered by the above types.

## Using Credentials

### Adding a Credential

1. Go to **Settings → Credentials** tab
2. Click **"Add Credential"**
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "My Twitter Account")
4. Select the credential type
5. Fill in the required fields
6. Click **"Add Credential"**

### Using in Automation Steps

1. When configuring a Twitter step (or other step that supports credentials)
2. You'll see an **"Authentication"** section
3. By default, you can select from your saved credentials
4. Click **"Enter Manually"** to switch to direct input if needed
5. Select your saved credential from the dropdown
6. The step will automatically use those credentials during execution

### Editing Credentials

1. Go to **Settings → Credentials**
2. Click **"Edit"** on the credential you want to modify
3. Update the fields (all fields are shown, even if stored as •••••••)
4. Click **"Save Changes"**

### Deleting Credentials

1. Go to **Settings → Credentials**
2. Click the trash icon on the credential you want to remove
3. Confirm deletion

⚠️ **Warning**: Deleting a credential will cause any automation steps using it to fail. Make sure to update those steps first.

## Security

### Encryption
Credentials are encrypted using:
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-CBC
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Random IV** for each encryption operation

### Storage Location
Encrypted credentials are stored in:
```
<userData>/credentials.json.enc
```

**User Data Locations:**
- **Linux**: `~/.config/loopi/credentials.json.enc`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/loopi/credentials.json.enc`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\loopi\credentials.json.enc`

### Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive names**: Name credentials clearly (e.g., "Production Twitter API" vs "Test Account")
2. **Rotate credentials regularly**: Update API keys and tokens periodically for security
3. **Don't share automations with embedded credentials**: Use credential references instead
4. **Backup carefully**: If backing up automations, be aware that credentials are stored separately
5. **Revoke unused credentials**: Remove old or unused credentials from both Loopi and the API provider

## Integration Examples

### Twitter Automation

1. Add Twitter credential:
   - Name: "My Twitter Account"
   - Type: Twitter/X
   - Fill in API keys from Twitter Developer Portal

2. In automation, add Twitter step:
   - Step: "Create Tweet"
   - Authentication: Select "My Twitter Account"
   - Tweet text: "Hello from Loopi!"

3. Run automation - credentials are used automatically

### API Integration

1. Add API Key credential:
   - Name: "OpenWeather API"
   - Type: API Key
   - API Key: Your key
   - API URL: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/`

2. In automation, use API Call step:
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `{{credentials.apiUrl}}weather?q=London&appid={{credentials.apiKey}}`
   - Store in: `weatherData`

## Troubleshooting

### Credential not appearing in dropdown
- Make sure you've saved the credential successfully
- Check that the credential type matches the step (e.g., Twitter credentials for Twitter steps)
- Try restarting the application

### Authentication fails
- Verify credentials are still valid at the API provider
- Check that all required fields are filled
- Ensure API permissions are correctly set
- Test credentials manually first

### Can't edit or delete credential
- Close any automations currently using the credential
- Try restarting the application
- Check file permissions on the credentials file

## API Provider Setup Guides

### Twitter API Credentials

1. Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
2. Create a new app or select an existing one
3. Navigate to **"Keys and tokens"** tab
4. Generate/copy:
   - API Key (Consumer Key)
   - API Secret (Consumer Secret)
   - Access Token
   - Access Token Secret
5. Ensure app has **Read, Write, and Direct Messages** permissions
6. Add credentials to Loopi

### GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"**
3. Select required scopes (e.g., `repo`, `user`)
4. Generate and copy the token
5. Add as "API Key" type credential in Loopi

### Generic OAuth 2.0

1. Register your application with the API provider
2. Obtain Client ID and Client Secret
3. Configure redirect URI (typically `http://localhost:3000/callback`)
4. Add as "OAuth 2.0" credential in Loopi
5. Follow provider's authentication flow
