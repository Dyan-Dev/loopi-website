# Getting Started

This guide helps you get Loopi running locally and create your first automation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** (>= 18 recommended)
- **npm** or **pnpm** package manager
- **Git** for cloning the repository

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dyan-Dev/loopi.git
cd loopi
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using pnpm (recommended):

```bash
pnpm install
```

Or using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development Mode

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will:
- Start the Electron application in development mode
- Enable hot reload for faster development
- Open the Loopi UI automatically

## Creating Your First Automation

Once the app is running, you'll see the main dashboard.

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

1. Click the **"Add Automation"** button in the dashboard
2. You'll be redirected to the workflow builder console
3. Navigate to **Settings** to name your automation

### Step 2: Add Steps

Click the **Navigate** node (added by default) to configure it:

1. In the properties panel, set the URL to your target website
2. Select next step by selecting the step in add next step panel
3. Choose from available node types.

**Navigate to a website:**
- Type: `Navigate`
- URL: `https://example.com`

**Extract text:**
- Type: `Extract`
- Selector: `h1`
- Store as: `pageTitle`

**Using Variables:**
- Type: `Set Variable`
- Variable Name: `productId`
- Value: `42` (automatically stored as number)

Then reference it later: `{{productId}}`

**Take a screenshot:**
- Type: `Screenshot`
- Save path: `example.png` (optional)

### Step 3: Using Variables

Loopi's **auto-typed variable system** automatically detects data types:

- `"42"` → stored as `number: 42`
- `"true"` → stored as `boolean: true`
- `'{"key":"value"}'` → stored as `object: {key: "value"}`
- `"[1,2,3]"` → stored as `array: [1,2,3]`
- `"text"` → stored as `string: "text"`

**Access variables with full syntax support:**
```
Simple: {{username}}
Nested: {{user.name}}
Arrays: {{users[0]}}
Mixed: {{users[0].name}}
Deep: {{response.data[0].meta.created_at}}
```

### Step 4: Run the Automation

1. Click the **"Run"** button
2. Watch the automation execute in a browser window

## Next Steps

Now that you have Loopi running:

- **Learn about Variables**: Read the [Variable System](/docs/variables) guide for type detection and access patterns
- **Learn more**: Read the [Usage Guide](/docs/usage) to understand all features
- **Try examples**: Check out [Examples](/docs/examples) for ready-made automations
- **Explore API**: See the [API Reference](/docs/api-reference) for advanced usage
- **Build & package**: Visit [Installation](/docs/installation) for packaging instructions

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start
- Make sure all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
- Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be >= 18)

### Browser window doesn't open
- Check console for errors
- Try closing and restarting the app
