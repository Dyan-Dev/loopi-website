# Getting Started

This guide helps you get Automa running locally and create your first automation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Node.js** (>= 18 recommended)
- **npm** or **pnpm** package manager
- **Git** for cloning the repository

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dyan-Dev/automa.git
cd automa
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Using pnpm (recommended):

```bash
pnpm install
```

Or using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development Mode

```bash
pnpm start
```

This will:
- Start the Electron application in development mode
- Enable hot reload for faster development
- Open the Automa UI automatically

## Creating Your First Automation

Once the app is running, you'll see the main dashboard.

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

**Navigate to a website:**

### Step 3: Run the Automation
