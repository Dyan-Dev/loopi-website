# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers about using Loopi.

## General Questions

### What is Loopi?

Loopi is a free, open-source visual browser automation platform. It lets you create browser automations using a drag-and-drop interface without writing code.

### Is Loopi really free?

Yes! Loopi is 100% free and open source under the MIT license.

### What platforms does Loopi support?

Loopi runs on:
- **Windows** (10 and later)
- **macOS** (11 Big Sur and later)
- **Linux** (Ubuntu 20.04+, Fedora 35+, or equivalent)

### Do I need to know programming?

No. Loopi is designed for visual automation without coding. However, basic understanding of web pages (HTML, CSS selectors) helps create more reliable automations.

## Installation & Setup

### How do I install Loopi?

See the [Installation Guide](/docs/installation) for detailed instructions. Quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dyan-Dev/loopi.git
cd loopi
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

### Which Node.js version do I need?

Node.js 18 or later is recommended. Check your version:

```bash
node --version
```

### Can I install Loopi without Git?

Yes, download the source as a ZIP file from GitHub, extract it, and run `pnpm install` in the extracted folder.

### The app won't start. What should I do?

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
2. Check Node.js version is >= 18
3. Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`
4. Check console for error messages

## Using Loopi

### How do I pick a reliable selector?

Use the **Pick Element** tool in step configuration:

1. Click "Pick Element" button
2. Browser opens with element picker
3. Hover and click the element you want
4. Loopi generates a CSS selector

**Prefer selectors with:**
- IDs: `#login-button`
- Stable classes: `.submit-btn`
- Name attributes: `input[name="email"]`

**Avoid:**
- Position-based: `div:nth-child(3)`
- Auto-generated classes: `.css-abc123`

### How do I use variables?

**Create a variable:**
```json
{
  "type": "setVariable",
  "variableName": "userName",
  "value": "John"
}
```

**Or extract from page:**
```json
{
  "type": "extract",
  "selector": ".username",
  "storeKey": "userName"
}
```

**Use in other steps:**
```
Hello {{userName}}!
https://example.com/user/{{userName}}
```

### Where are screenshots saved?

Screenshots are saved to:
- **Specified path** if you provide `savePath`
- **Current directory** if no path is specified
- **Filename format**: `screenshot_timestamp.png` (if no path given)

### How do I handle dynamic content?

Use **Wait** steps to give content time to load:

```json
{
  "type": "wait",
  "value": "2"  // Wait 2 seconds
}
```

Or use **Extract with Logic** to wait for specific conditions.

### Why does my automation fail on some websites?

Common reasons:
- **Dynamic loading**: Add wait steps
- **Anti-bot protection**: Some sites block automation
- **Iframe content**: Elements in iframes need special handling
- **JavaScript rendering**: Wait for JS to complete

### Can I automate login forms?

Yes, but be careful:
- Don't commit credentials to Git
- Use environment variables or credential vault
- Check site's Terms of Service
- Consider using API tokens instead

### How do I debug failed automations?

1. **Use Debug/Step Mode**: Run one step at a time
2. **Add screenshots**: Capture state at each step
3. **Check console**: Open DevTools for errors
4. **Simplify**: Remove steps until you find the issue
5. **Test selectors**: Verify in browser DevTools

## Advanced Usage

### Can I loop through multiple items?

Not yet built-in, but planned for future releases. Current workaround:
- Use variables to track iteration
- Manually increment counters
- Check community for custom solutions

### How do I scrape data from multiple pages?

Use variables for page numbers:

```json
{
  "type": "navigate",
  "value": "https://example.com/page/{{pageNumber}}"
}
```

Then increment `pageNumber` and repeat. Full pagination support coming soon.

### Can I integrate with external APIs?

Yes! Use the **API Call** step:

```json
{
  "type": "apiCall",
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/data",
  "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer {{token}}"},
  "body": "{\"data\": \"{{extractedValue}}\"}",
  "storeKey": "apiResponse"
}
```

### How do I handle authentication?

Options:
1. **Session cookies**: Navigate and log in first
2. **API tokens**: Store in variables, use in headers
3. **Credentials step**: Use `credentialId` in Type step

### Can I schedule automations to run automatically?

Scheduling is a planned feature. Current options:
- Use OS task scheduler (cron, Task Scheduler, launchd)
- Run via command line and automate externally
- Watch for community plugins

- What you want to do
- Why it's useful
- Example use cases

## Performance & Limits

### How many steps can an automation have?

No hard limit, but very large automations (100+ steps) may:
- Be harder to debug
- Use more memory
- Take longer to execute

Consider breaking into smaller, reusable automations.

### Can I run multiple automations at once?

Currently one at a time. Concurrent execution is planned for future releases.

### Does Loopi work on slow internet?

Yes, but you may need to:
- Increase wait times
- Use longer timeouts
- Handle network errors gracefully

### What's the maximum page size Loopi can handle?

Depends on your system resources. Very large pages may:
- Take longer to load
- Use more memory
- Slow down element selection

## Troubleshooting

### Element not found error

**Causes:**
- Selector is wrong
- Page hasn't loaded yet
- Element is in an iframe
- Element is dynamically generated

**Solutions:**
- Use Pick Element tool
- Add Wait step before interaction
- Check if element exists with Extract with Logic
- Verify selector in DevTools

### Variables not substituting

**Check:**
- Variable name spelling: `{{varName}}` not `{{var_name}}`
- Variable was set before use
- Exact `{{}}` syntax
- No extra spaces: `{{var}}` not `{{ var }}`

### Automation runs too fast

Add **Wait** steps between actions:
```json
{ "type": "wait", "value": "1" }
```

Or use smart waits that wait for specific elements.

### Browser window doesn't close

Check for:
- Errors during execution
- Infinite loops
- Missing final step

Manually close with `browser:close` IPC call or restart Loopi.

## Security & Privacy

### Is my data safe?

Yes. Loopi runs locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers unless you explicitly use API Call steps.

### Should I share my automations?

Safe to share:
- Step configurations
- Selectors
- Public URLs

**Never share:**
- Credentials
- API keys
- Personal data
- Private URLs

### Can websites detect Loopi?

Some websites may detect automation through:
- WebDriver detection
- Mouse/keyboard patterns
- Request headers

Always respect website Terms of Service.
